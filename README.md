> # quick2link-MERN
MERN version of my quick2link project. 

It will essentially contain the links to my frequently used websites just like my quick2link-frontend-only
project. Besides this, I will add more & more features in it as I learn them. 
 
`next.txt` file will contain the topics that I will implement sooner to this repo.
